# Message Pair 1: Founder Transition Angle

## LinkedIn Message

Hi Miguel, I noticed you've been building companies for over 7 years. I'm reaching out about a Senior Data Engineer role at Causeway Technologies that might offer an interesting shift: all the innovation challenges of a startup (they're 3 years into a major digital transformation), but with the stability of the UK's leading construction software company. Fully remote from Lisbon, heavy Python and data science work. Worth a quick chat?

**Subject:** Re: Senior Data Engineer role at Causeway

Hi Miguel,

Following up on my LinkedIn message about the Causeway opportunity. Since you have a postgraduate degree in Data Science from NOVA IMS, this role would put those credentials to work building data pipelines with Python, PySpark, and cloud platforms for a company that powers construction projects across the UK. They're carbon-neutral and working on infrastructure that impacts millions of people.

Here's the full job description: https://causeway-1588594217.teamtailor.com/jobs/6553337-senior-data-engineer

Happy to send you a calendar link if you'd like to discuss how this compares to the founder path you've been on.

Best,
[Your name]
