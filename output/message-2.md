**Subject:** Fully remote Senior Data Engineer opportunity from Lisbon

Hi Miguel,

Since you're clearly aligned with remote work through Remote Crew, I wanted to share more context on this Causeway role. You'd be working with Python, PySpark, SQL, and cloud platforms to build data solutions for 3,000+ construction customers. The company is in year 3 of a digital transformation, so there's plenty of complexity and innovation to work with.

Let me know if you'd like a call link to explore whether this could be a fit. No pressure either way.

Best,
[Your name]
